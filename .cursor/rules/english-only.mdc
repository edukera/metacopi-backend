# 🌐 Write Everything in Clear US English

This project follows a strict language guideline to maximize readability and accessibility for an international developer audience.

## ✅ Requirements

- Use **standard American English (US)** in all code, comments, commit messages, PRs, and documentation.
- Prefer **simple, unambiguous vocabulary**.
- Avoid:
  - Slang or idioms
  - Cultural references
  - Non-English words (unless part of a name or identifier)
- Use **present simple tense** in comments and documentation (e.g., "Returns the user ID", not "Has returned the user ID").

## ✅ Naming conventions

- All variable, function, class, and file names must be in **clear and descriptive English**.
- Use consistent naming patterns across the codebase.

## ✅ Examples

// ✅ DO: Clear and simple
// Returns the list of users

// ❌ DON'T: Confusing or idiomatic
// Grabs the user list from upstream

// ✅ DO: Descriptive identifier
const totalAmount = calculateTotal(items);

## 📌 Applies to

- All source code (identifiers, variable names, etc.)
- All inline and block comments
- All Markdown documentation
- All GitHub interactions: commits, PRs, issues

## 🎯 Goal

Ensure that developers from any background can easily read, understand, and contribute to this project.
